# Reading in Data 

```{r}
{r}
#setwd tells R where to look to look for your data. If you do not tell it the correct working directory it will give you an error. 
setwd("/Users/d.gaytan/Library/CloudStorage/Box-Box/neg_exp")

#this is actually grabbing the data from your computer and putting it in R. In this case (since I am basic) I choose to name my data data. read.csv is the function and the file name goes inside the parantheses and then inside the commas. 
data = read.csv("clean_data.csv")

#I then tell R that I want you to omit any incomplete data and to save it as a dataframe named data. 
data<-na.omit(data)

#view the dataframe, I just like to check to make sure everything looks good. 
view(data)

#renaming columns for easier coding: Week#1 work begins here 
colnames(data)[colnames(data) == "Q71"] <- "attn_check"
```
